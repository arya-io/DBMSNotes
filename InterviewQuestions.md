```bash
    Don't answer everything.
    When asked about GROUP BY clause, tell only about GROUP BY only. Don't jump to HAVING.
    Even if you know more, keep it for yourself. Give answer only what is asked.
    If you don't know the answer, don't answer then. Don't give incorrect answer. Just say I am not able to recollect at the moment.
    Giving the wrong answer makes a bad impression. Being humble gives a good impression.
    When you are asked about a function and don't know its name but know its working, you can just explain its working.
    The interviewee will himself help to recollect that name.
